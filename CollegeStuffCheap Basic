<title> Free Things You Can Get With A&M Email </title>
<body>
  <h1 style="text-align:center" id="top"> Welcome To CollegeStuffCheap.xyz a Place to Find Things for Cheap Because You're a Broke College Student </h1>
    <p style="text-align:center"> Here you will find a collection of things that you can use your
    A&M email or ID to get cheaper or even free. <br/> I made this webssite because
    after a lot of time digging I have realized there are a lot of weird things you can get for free just
    by being a college student.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center"> This website is also honestly just a way for me to learn HTML and how to build
    webpages, but I hope it can be a bit of a help!</p>
    <p style="text-align: center"> If you know of any good things you can get
    for cheap send me a message on Discord WheeSnaaw#6512 and I'll add it onto here!<br/> (if you
    are interesting in learning how I did this you can also shoot me a message and we can talk about it)<br/>
    (a short explanation of it is I'm hosting a server off of Oracle's Virtual Private Servers and am hosting
    a basic early internet era looking webpage)</p>
